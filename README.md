# llm compiler
The start of an llm compiler

## Running the code
```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Goals

My main goal is not to build the next tvm. That would be silly.

But I do want to make a deep learning compiler capable of compiling a VGG block to C code and Cuda call and do some optimizations. Thats what I want to build.
